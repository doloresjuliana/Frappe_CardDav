## Frappe CardDav

**App for Frappe** that extends the functionality of your contact list allowing you to import and export your data to other systems that use **vCard** as a data exchange format.

Of course it works with **ERPNEXT contacts** or any other app built with Frappe and that makes use of its contacts doctype.

App in a **very preliminary state**, it is in the first phase of development 
# Its installation in its current state is not recommended
