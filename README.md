## Frappe CardDav

**App for Frappe** that extends the functionality of your contact list allowing you to import and export your data to other systems that use **vCard** as a data exchange format.

Of course it works with **ERPNEXT contacts** or any other app built with Frappe and that makes use of its contacts doctype.

App in a **very preliminary state**, it is in the first phase of development. From the functional scope detailed below, **points 1 and 2 are currently developed**.
## Its installation in its current state is not recommended 

## Functional scope:

**Manual integration with applications that use vCard in version 4.0:**

1. Generate and **download a .vcf file** with the vCard of a **specific contact**
2. Generate and **download a .vcf file** with all the vCard of the **Frappe contact book**
3. Direct **upload of a new contact in Frappe** using a .vcf file generated by another application
4. **Loading of a .vcf file with a contact book** coming from another system. This process will be carried out **in two steps when the Frappe agenda already has contacts**, the user's confirmation being necessary to upload the received vCards to the Frappe contact master. The process will do a duplicate check and will **mark the records as potential duplicates** based on: full name, phone and email.
 
**Automatic calendar synchronization with certain applications that act as a CardDAV server:**

5. It will allow you to **configure multiple contact books to be synchronized**, identifying the system, the contact book, the access credentials and if you want to perform **pull and push or only one of the two operations**
6. **At the time of registration and modification of contacts in Frappe**, a push will be executed in the systems and contact books configured with this operation
7. **A scheduled task with the periodicity estimated** by the Frappe administrator will execute the total synchronization of the schedules.

It is not part of the scope of this app to turn Frappe into a CardDAV server, it will simply act as a client of other systems that are.

It is not considered in scope for Frappe to sync with all applications that act as CardDAV servers. It is also not considered in scope to assume older versions of vCard.
 
Synchronization with Nextcloud and for vCard version 4.0 will be tested.

## Design and usability:

When you install this app, new buttons and menu options will appear on the contact screens. The app does not have its own workspace for its module, it is limited to extending the functionality of Frappe contacts and without them it makes no sense.

Once the development of the entire functional scope is finished, a detailed explanation of each enabled option or button will be included here.
These are some of those included in the current state of development:
